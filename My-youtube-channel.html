    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Standalone mics are better than headsets! Its esaier to talk to friends with standalone mics than with headsets (but still consider headphones).
        <li>Do a wide virity of things! If you just do one thing than only the people that like that thing will watch but if you do more things than all the people that like that thing will watch.
        <li>Get a good camrea and maybe a webcam! Everyone likes a better vedio and everyone wants to see your face.
